# OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a networking system. It divides the networking process into seven layers, each serving a specific role in communication between devices. Below is a brief overview of each layer, starting from the top:

7. **Application Layer**: 
   - The top layer, where end-user applications and services reside. This layer interacts directly with software applications and provides network services to them. Protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP are part of this layer.

6. **Presentation Layer**: 
   - Translates data between the application layer and the network, handling data encoding, compression, and encryption. It ensures that data is in a readable format for the application.

5. **Session Layer**: 
   - Manages sessions between applications, facilitating the establishment, maintenance, and termination of connections. It helps manage communication sessions.

4. **Transport Layer**: 
   - Ensures reliable data transfer between end systems and provides error recovery and flow control. Protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) operate here.

3. **Network Layer**: 
   - Manages data routing, forwarding, and addressing. It determines the best path for data to travel across a network. The Internet Protocol (IP) is a key protocol at this layer.

2. **Data Link Layer**: 
   - Responsible for node-to-node data transfer, error detection and correction, as well as managing how data packets are framed for transmission. Protocols like Ethernet operate at this layer.

1. **Physical Layer**: 
   - Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and the electrical signals transmitted over these mediums.

The OSI model helps standardize networking protocols and improve communication across diverse systems. It also aids in troubleshooting by allowing network professionals to isolate issues to specific layers.
