# Sync vs Async

"Sync" (synchronous) and "async" (asynchronous) refer to two different ways of handling tasks, especially in programming.

## Synchronous (Sync)
- **Blocking**: In a synchronous operation, the program waits for the task to complete before moving on to the next one. This can lead to inefficiencies, especially if a task takes a long time (like a network request).
- **Sequential Execution**: Tasks are executed one after another, in the order they are called. If one task takes time, subsequent tasks are delayed.
- **Simplicity**: Code tends to be simpler and easier to read, as the flow is linear.

**Example**: If you have 10 requests that each take 5 seconds to complete, a synchronous approach would result in a total time of 50 seconds (10 requests Ã— 5 seconds each) because each request must finish before the next one starts.

## Asynchronous (Async)
- **Non-Blocking**: In an asynchronous operation, the program can continue executing other tasks while waiting for a long-running task to complete. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks like network requests.
- **Concurrency**: Tasks can be executed out of order or in parallel, which can improve performance for certain applications.
- **Complexity**: Async code can be harder to read and understand due to the non-linear flow and use of callbacks or `async/await` syntax.

**Example**: If you have 10 requests that each take 5 seconds to complete, an asynchronous approach can handle all requests simultaneously. Therefore, the total time would be just 5 seconds (the time taken for the longest single request) instead of 50 seconds.

## When to Use
- **Sync**: When tasks are quick, simple, or when blocking behavior is acceptable.
- **Async**: When tasks are I/O-bound, such as fetching data from APIs or reading/writing files, and you want to improve responsiveness or throughput.

In summary, choose sync for simplicity and predictability, and async for performance and responsiveness in I/O-bound tasks.
