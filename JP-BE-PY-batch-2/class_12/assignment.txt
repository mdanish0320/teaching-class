Dave.withdraw(10000) # it should raise an error saying "Sorry, account 'Dave' only has a balance of $1000"
Dave.withdraw(10)   # should subtract $10 from Dave's account
Dave.get_balance()  # should display $990

Dave.transfer(10000, Sara) # it should raise an error saying "Sorry, account 'Dave' only has a balance of $990"
Dave.transfer(100, Sara)   # should add $100 to Sara's account and remove $100 from Dave's account
