These principles, coined by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob), 
are intended to improve the design, maintainability, and scalability of software systems.

The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, in the early 2000s. 
He first mentioned these principles in a series of articles titled "The Principles of Object-Oriented Design," 
published in his column in the magazine "C++ Report" in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
