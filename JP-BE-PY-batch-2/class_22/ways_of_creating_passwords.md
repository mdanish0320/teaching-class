Let’s go over the correct and secure ways to create and update passwords in Django. I will explain the process clearly and point out any corrections in the code.

## **1. Creating a User and Password Using `set_password()`**

In this method, you first create a `User` instance, set the password using the `set_password()` method (which securely hashes the password), and then save the user.

#### **Correct Code**:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Create a user instance
user = User(
    username=data['username'],
)

# Hash and set the password
user.set_password(data['password'])

# Save the user instance to the database
user.save()
```

### **Explanation**:
- `set_password()` hashes the plain text password securely using Django's default hashing algorithm (e.g., PBKDF2).
- The `save()` method then saves the `User` object, along with the hashed password, into the database.

## **2. Using `make_password()` to Manually Hash a Password**

If you need to hash a password separately and store it, you can use `make_password()` from `django.contrib.auth.hashers`. This is useful if you're dealing with custom user models or manual user creation.

#### **Correct Code**:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.hashers import make_password
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Hash the password using make_password
hashed_password = make_password('mypassword123')

# You can now manually store this hashed password in the database
user = User.objects.create(username='myuser', password=hashed_password)
```

### **Explanation**:
- `make_password()` hashes the password (you can specify your own salt or leave it to use a randomly generated one).
- You then pass the hashed password to the `User` object’s `password` field and save it directly using `User.objects.create()`.

**Note**: When you use `make_password()` and pass the hashed password to the `User` object, **do not** call `set_password()` again since the password is already hashed.

## **3. Updating a User’s Password**

To update the password for an existing user, use the `set_password()` method to hash the new password, and then call `save()`.

#### **Correct Code**:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Retrieve the user by primary key (or other filters)
user = User.objects.get(pk=1)

# Set the new password (this will hash it)
user.set_password('new_password')

# Save the updated user object with the new hashed password
user.save()
```

### **Explanation**:
- When updating a password, you **must** use `set_password()` to ensure that the new password is hashed securely.
- Calling `save()` ensures the hashed password is updated in the database.

### **Additional Information**

- **Why Use `set_password()`**: This is the safest way to store a password. It ensures that the password is hashed using Django’s configured password hasher (such as PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2), which makes it more resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
  
- **`make_password()` vs `set_password()`**: While `make_password()` gives you control over hashing the password separately, `set_password()` is preferred when working with Django’s built-in `User` model since it handles everything behind the scenes (including hashing and salting).

---

### **Final Summary**:
Here’s a concise summary of the correct ways to handle passwords in Django:

1. **Creating a User with `set_password()`**:  
   - `set_password()` hashes the password before saving the user, ensuring security.

2. **Using `make_password()` to Manually Hash Passwords**:  
   - Use `make_password()` to hash the password manually if needed. Useful when storing the hash directly into a custom user model or the database.

3. **Updating User Passwords with `set_password()`**:  
   - Always use `set_password()` when updating a user’s password to ensure it gets hashed before being saved in the database.

All the corrected code provided in the examples follows Django’s best practices for securely handling passwords.
