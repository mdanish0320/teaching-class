Even though the salt is stored alongside the hashed password and is visible in the database, it still provides significant security benefits. The visibility of the salt does not compromise the security of the hashed password. Here's why:

### Why Salt is Still Effective Even When Visible

1. **Prevents Rainbow Table Attacks**: 
   - A rainbow table is a precomputed table of hashed values for common passwords. Attackers use it to quickly find a matching hash for a given password.
   - Without salt, if two users have the same password, their hashes will be identical, making it easier for attackers to crack multiple accounts at once using rainbow tables.
   - With salt, even if two users have the same password, the hashes will be different because the salt is unique for each password. This renders precomputed rainbow tables useless, as attackers would need to compute a separate table for each salt.

2. **Slows Down Brute-Force Attacks**: 
   - Brute-force attacks involve trying many possible passwords until the correct one is found.
   - Even though the salt is visible, an attacker would still need to compute the hash for each password attempt *with that specific salt*. This means that attackers cannot reuse work they’ve done to precompute hashes for common passwords across different accounts or databases.
   - Additionally, secure hashing algorithms (like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2) are designed to be slow, making brute-force attacks time-consuming and computationally expensive.

3. **Salts are Random**:
   - The salt is typically generated randomly for each password. This randomness ensures that even if the same password is used by multiple users, the hashes will be completely different, making it harder for attackers to gain any advantage from the salt.
   
4. **Salts Don’t Need to Be Secret**:
   - Salts are not meant to be secret values; they are simply random values added to the password to make attacks more difficult. The security of the system does not depend on keeping the salt hidden. Instead, it depends on:
     - The randomness of the salt.
     - The strength of the hashing algorithm.
     - The strength of the user's password.

### Example of How Salt Works

Let's assume two users have the same password, "mypassword123". If there were no salt, their hashes would look identical, making it easier for an attacker to compromise both accounts if they crack one password.

- Without Salt:
  ```
  User1: hash('mypassword123') -> e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03
  User2: hash('mypassword123') -> e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03
  ```

With salt, each user's password hash is unique, even if they use the same password:

- With Salt:
  ```
  User1: hash('mypassword123' + salt1) -> pbkdf2_sha256$260000$Nz5sxrX1$W+TReHxJZcIw7EyO0Av2g1a+tU4wE0ry2wv/Ptp4N9E=
  User2: hash('mypassword123' + salt2) -> pbkdf2_sha256$260000$P5YpzUjt$DgQF8ZmMjThEJ4xfBxKMevVOr+kQzKDBjCjpXf9VRTU=
  ```

Even if an attacker can see both salts (`salt1` and `salt2`), they would still need to perform separate brute-force or dictionary attacks for each user because the hashes are different.

### How Password Security is Achieved

- **Hashing Algorithm**: The strength of the hashing algorithm (e.g., PBKDF2, bcrypt) plays a key role in making passwords hard to crack. These algorithms are slow and computationally intensive by design, making brute-force attacks more challenging.
  
- **Password Strength**: A strong password (one that is long, complex, and unique) is still crucial. Even with a secure hashing mechanism and salt, weak passwords (like "123456") can still be brute-forced relatively easily.

- **Salt Randomness**: The salt ensures that the same password will have different hashes every time, even if stored in the same database or across different users, making attacks much harder.

### Conclusion

The visibility of the salt in the database does not weaken the security of the hashed password. Its purpose is to ensure that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different, thus thwarting precomputed rainbow table attacks and making brute-force attacks more difficult. The security of the system relies on the strength of the hashing algorithm, the randomness of the salt, and the strength of the user's password.
