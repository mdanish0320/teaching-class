### 1. **Application (Global) Level Permissions**
   - These are permissions applied globally across the entire application, often set in the **`settings.py`** file. They are checked for all API requests unless overridden by specific view-level permissions.
   - **Example**: 
     ```python
     REST_FRAMEWORK = {
         'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
             'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
         ],
     }
     ```
     In this case, all API views require authentication globally unless a view specifies a different permission class.

   - **Purpose**: This ensures broad-level access control, such as requiring users to be authenticated across the whole API.

---

### 2. **Model (Table) Level Permissions**
   - **DjangoModelPermissions** are based on Django's built-in model-level permissions, such as `add`, `change`, `delete`, and `view` for a particular model (or database table). These permissions are tied to actions on the entire model rather than specific rows (objects).
   - **How it works**: You can assign these permissions through Django’s admin interface or programmatically to users or groups.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     @permission_classes([DjangoModelPermissions])
     def create_post(request):
         # Logic for creating a post
     ```
     This permission ensures the user has the necessary permission (e.g., `add_post`) to create a new instance of the `Post` model.

   - **Purpose**: This is useful for granting users specific permissions at the model level, ensuring they can perform actions like creating, updating, or deleting any instance of the model.

---

### 3. **Object (Row) Level Permissions**
   - **DjangoObjectPermissions** focus on whether a user has permission to interact with specific **instances** (rows) of a model rather than the entire model. This allows for very fine-grained control.
   - **How it works**: Instead of checking global permissions for the model, the system checks whether the user has permission to act on a specific object.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     @permission_classes([DjangoObjectPermissions])
     def update_post(request, post_id):
         # Logic for updating a specific post
     ```
     Here, the user must have the appropriate permission for this specific post (e.g., `can_edit_this_post`) rather than just general model permissions.

   - **Purpose**: Object-level permissions are useful in scenarios where a user should be able to perform actions only on specific resources. For instance, an author can edit or delete only their own posts.

---

### 4. **Custom Permissions**
   - **Custom permissions** are defined by extending the `BasePermission` class and creating logic specific to your application’s needs. You override the `has_permission` and/or `has_object_permission` methods to build your custom logic.
   
   - **OR-based Permission Example**:
     Sometimes, you want to combine multiple permissions and allow access if **either** of the permissions return `True`. This is possible with custom permissions by combining them in an "OR" logic.
     ```python
     from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission

     class IsAdminOrModerator(BasePermission):
         """
         Allow access if the user is an admin or a moderator.
         """
         def has_permission(self, request, view):
             return request.user.user_type in ['admin', 'moderator']
     ```

     **Usage**:
     ```python
     @permission_classes([IsAdminOrModerator])
     def delete_post(request, post_id):
         # Logic for deleting a post
     ```
     This example allows a user to delete a post if they are either an **admin** or a **moderator**, combining both roles with an "OR" condition.

   - **Real-life Custom Permission Example**:
     Consider a scenario where only **authors** are allowed to edit or delete **their own** posts. This requires custom logic that checks if the user is both an author and the owner of the post. This scenario cannot be handled by model or object-level permissions alone.

     ```python
     from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission

     class IsAuthorAndOwner(BasePermission):
         """
         Custom permission to allow authors to edit or delete their own posts.
         """
         def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
             # Only allow if the user is the author and owns the post
             return request.user.user_type == 'author' and obj.author == request.user
     ```

     **Usage**:
     ```python
     @permission_classes([IsAuthorAndOwner])
     def update_post(request, post_id):
         # Logic for updating a specific post
     ```
     Here, only the **author** who owns the post can update or delete it. This fine-tuned control requires a custom permission, as built-in permissions cannot handle such a specific condition.

   - **Purpose**: Custom permissions are used when you need fine-grained control or specific logic that is not provided by Django's default permissions. They are flexible and can cover a wide range of complex use cases, such as combining permissions, creating role-based permissions, or adding business-specific rules.

### Summary:

1. **Application (Global) Level**: Permissions applied across the entire application (e.g., `IsAuthenticated` in `settings.py`).
2. **Model (Table) Level**: Permissions that control access to entire models (e.g., `DjangoModelPermissions`).
3. **Object (Row) Level**: Permissions that control access to specific instances of models (e.g., `DjangoObjectPermissions`).
4. **Custom Permissions**: Custom-built permissions that handle specific scenarios (e.g., combining "OR" permissions or checking if a user is the owner of an object)
