In Django Rest Framework (DRF), permissions are crucial to controlling access to views and resources. Here’s a list of the most commonly used built-in permissions along with application-level permissions you can teach to your students:

### 1. `rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny`
- Grants unrestricted access to any user, regardless of authentication.

### 2. `rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated`
- Grants access only to authenticated users. Unauthenticated users get a 401 Unauthorized response.

### 3. `rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser`
- Grants access only to users who are staff members (superusers or users with the staff status in Django).

### 4. `rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`
- Grants read-only access to unauthenticated users, and full access to authenticated users.

### 5. `rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissions`
- Grants access based on Django’s model-level permissions (`add`, `change`, `delete`, `view`). This applies to views that operate on querysets.

### 6. `rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly`
- Similar to `DjangoModelPermissions`, but allows read-only access for unauthenticated users.

### 7. `rest_framework.permissions.DjangoObjectPermissions`
- Grants access based on Django's object-level permissions, allowing more granular control on individual objects rather than model-wide access.

### 8. Custom Permissions
- You can create custom permission classes by subclassing `BasePermission`. For example, you can limit access to certain resources based on custom logic, such as user roles or other conditions specific to your app.

Here’s a simple custom permission example:

```python
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission

class IsOwnerOrReadOnly(BasePermission):
    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        if request.method in ['GET', 'HEAD', 'OPTIONS']:
            return True
        return obj.owner == request.user
```

### 9. `rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticatedAndCustomPermission`
- If needed, you can chain multiple permissions by combining them. For example, combining built-in permissions like `IsAuthenticated` and custom ones to create more specific logic.
