### Why `login` and `logout` aren’t used with JWT

- **Session-based Authentication**: The `login(request, user)` function in Django is used to associate a user with the current session. It adds session data to the server and sets a session cookie on the client. This approach doesn't work with JWT, as JWT is stateless and doesn't rely on server-side sessions.
- **JWT Tokens**: With JWT authentication, you authenticate users by creating JWT tokens (access and refresh tokens) that are returned to the client. These tokens are then sent in subsequent requests as part of the authorization header, and no server-side session is created.

### Using JWT Authentication

In the context of JWT authentication with **DRF** using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`, you should use the following methods to handle token generation and user login/logout functionality:

1. **Authenticate the user** using `authenticate()` from `django.contrib.auth`.
2. **Generate JWT tokens** using `RefreshToken.for_user(user)` for the authenticated user.
3. **Logout** by invalidating or deleting the refresh token on the client side (JWT doesn’t have a true logout mechanism, but you can blacklist the token if needed).

### Workflow for JWT Authentication

#### 1. **Login with JWT** (Token generation)

In JWT authentication, instead of calling Django's `login()` function, you authenticate the user and generate JWT tokens. Here’s an example:

```python
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate
from rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens import RefreshToken

def jwt_login_view(request):
    # Authenticate the user
    user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)

    if user is not None:
        # User is authenticated, generate JWT tokens
        refresh = RefreshToken.for_user(user)
        access_token = refresh.access_token

        return Response({
            'refresh': str(refresh),
            'access': str(access_token)
        })

@api_view(['GET'])
def user_detail_view(request):
    request.user.is_authenticated
```

#### 2. **Logout with JWT**

With JWT, **logout** isn’t as straightforward as session-based logout. Since JWT is stateless, you don’t need to call Django’s `logout()` function, as there is no session to clear.

However, you can simulate logout by doing one of the following:

- **Delete the token** on the client side (effectively "logging out" by preventing further requests).
- **Blacklist the token** on the server side (optional) by using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`’s **token blacklisting** feature. This ensures that even if the token is still valid, it will be blocked.

Here’s how you can blacklist the refresh token (if token blacklisting is enabled):

```python
from rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens import RefreshToken
from rest_framework.response import Response

def jwt_logout_view(request):
    try:
        # Get refresh token from the request (or send it from the frontend)
        refresh_token = request.data.get('refresh')

        # Blacklist the refresh token to invalidate it
        token = RefreshToken(refresh_token)
        token.blacklist()

        return Response({"detail": "Logged out successfully"}, status=status.HTTP_205_RESET_CONTENT)
    except Exception as e:
        return Response({"detail": "Something went wrong"}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
