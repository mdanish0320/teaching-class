### Important Points about `SECRET_KEY` of `settings.py`

1. **Definition and Security**:
   - The `SECRET_KEY` is a critical setting in Django, used for signing and securing various components of the framework.
   - **Protecting the Variable**: To secure the `SECRET_KEY`, itâ€™s best practice to store it in an environment variable instead of hardcoding it in your `settings.py`. This can be done using the `os` module:
     ```python
     import os
     SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY', 'your-default-secret-key')
     ```

2. **Usage**:
   - **Encryption/Decryption**: The `SECRET_KEY` is used for signing tokens and other sensitive information (like cookies). It ensures that these items cannot be tampered with.
   - **Not Used in Hashing**: The `SECRET_KEY` is **not** involved in the password hashing process. Django uses secure hashing algorithms (like PBKDF2, Argon2, etc.) that do not require a key, and passwords are stored as hashes without relying on the `SECRET_KEY`.

3. **Impact of Updating the Key**:
   - **User Sessions**: Changing the `SECRET_KEY` will invalidate all existing user sessions. This affects cookie-based authentication and JWT tokens (when using `rest_framework_simplejwt`). All users will need to re-login to obtain new valid sessions.
   - **Login and User Creation**: Updating the `SECRET_KEY` will **not** impact the login or creation of new users since the `SECRET_KEY` is not used in those processes.

4. **Additional Security Functions**:
   - The `SECRET_KEY` is used in various security mechanisms, including:
     - **CSRF Protection**: Helps prevent cross-site request forgery attacks by generating CSRF tokens.
     - **Password Reset Tokens**: Used to generate secure tokens for password resets.
     - **Session Management**: Signs session cookies to ensure their integrity.
