To optimize the query, you should decide which model you start with based on the data you're querying and the relationships involved. Let's break it down:

### Relationships Recap:
1. **Product ↔ Order**: Many-to-Many (via `Order_Product` table).
2. **Product ↔ Order_Product**: One-to-Many (since `Order_Product` is an intermediary table).

Given this, you should:
- Use **`select_related`** for **foreign key** or **one-to-one** relationships (which translates to SQL `JOIN`).
- Use **`prefetch_related`** for **many-to-many** or **reverse foreign key** relationships (which translates to multiple queries, but reduces redundant queries).

### 1. **Optimizing from the Product Side**:

When querying products and fetching related orders and order products:

```python
products = Product.objects.select_related('category').prefetch_related(
    'order_product_set__order'  # Fetch all orders related through the Order_Product table
).all()
```

Here’s what happens:
- `select_related('category')`: If `Product` has a foreign key to `Category`, this will use a SQL `JOIN` to fetch the category in a single query.
- `prefetch_related('order_product_set__order')`: This will prefetch all related `Order_Product` entries and the associated `Order` data. Prefetch works by issuing a second query to get the `Order_Product` entries and another to fetch related `Orders`. This avoids the N+1 query problem when dealing with many-to-many relationships.

### 2. **Optimizing from the Order Side**:

When querying orders and fetching related products through the `Order_Product` table:

```python
orders = Order.objects.prefetch_related(
    'order_product_set__product'  # Fetch all products related through the Order_Product table
).all()
```

Here’s what happens:
- `prefetch_related('order_product_set__product')`: This will prefetch the related `Order_Product` entries and their associated products using two additional queries: one for `Order_Product` and one for `Product`. This way, it efficiently retrieves products without executing one query per order (avoiding the N+1 problem).

### Which One to Choose?

#### Case 1: Start with **Product** (`Product.objects.select_related()`)
- Use this if your goal is to display or work with **products** and you want to include information about related orders.
- This is helpful when you're focusing primarily on product details but need some info about associated orders.

#### Case 2: Start with **Order** (`Order.objects.prefetch_related()`)
- Use this if your goal is to display or work with **orders** and you want to include information about related products.
- This is useful when your focus is on orders and you're trying to show which products were ordered.

### Query Comparison:
- **`Product.objects.select_related()`**: Best for querying and focusing on **products** and fetching their related orders.
- **`Order.objects.prefetch_related()`**: Best for querying and focusing on **orders** and fetching their related products.

### Example Query for **Product** with Related Orders and Order Products:
```python
products = Product.objects.select_related('category').prefetch_related(
    'order_product_set__order'  # Order_Product -> Order relationship
).all()
```

### Example Query for **Order** with Related Products:
```python
orders = Order.objects.prefetch_related(
    'order_product_set__product'  # Order_Product -> Product relationship
).all()
```

### Conclusion:
- If you're working mainly with products, use the **`Product.objects.select_related()`** query.
- If you're working mainly with orders, use the **`Order.objects.prefetch_related()`** query.

Both approaches will avoid N+1 query problems and minimize database hits by optimizing queries based on relationships.
