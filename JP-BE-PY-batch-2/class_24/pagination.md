Django Rest Framework (DRF) supports several types of pagination, each suited for different use cases. The main types of pagination in DRF are:

### 1. **PageNumberPagination**
This is the most commonly used pagination method. It works similarly to traditional pagination, where data is divided into pages, and you can navigate between them using page numbers.

- **URL Example**: `/api/items/?page=2`
- **Configuration**: You specify the page size, and clients can access different pages by providing a `page` query parameter.
- **Settings**:
    ```python
    from rest_framework.pagination import PageNumberPagination

    class CustomPageNumberPagination(PageNumberPagination):
        page_size = 10  # Number of items per page
        page_size_query_param = 'page_size'  # Allow clients to set the page size
        max_page_size = 100  # Maximum page size allowed
    ```

- **Pros**:
  - Simple and intuitive.
  - Easy to implement and use.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Can be inefficient for large datasets since querying specific pages may require counting all records up to that page.

### 2. **LimitOffsetPagination**
This pagination style allows the client to specify an offset (the number of items to skip) and a limit (the maximum number of items to return). It is useful for more flexible pagination control.

- **URL Example**: `/api/items/?limit=10&offset=20`
- **Configuration**: You specify a default limit, and clients can control both the number of items to fetch (`limit`) and the starting position (`offset`).
- **Settings**:
    ```python
    from rest_framework.pagination import LimitOffsetPagination

    class CustomLimitOffsetPagination(LimitOffsetPagination):
        default_limit = 10  # Number of items to return by default
        max_limit = 100  # Maximum number of items allowed in a single response
        limit_query_param = 'limit'  # Query parameter for limit
        offset_query_param = 'offset'  # Query parameter for offset
    ```

- **Pros**:
  - More control over data fetching compared to page numbers.
  - Suitable for large datasets where jumping to specific offsets is needed.

- **Cons**:
  - Offset-based pagination can become slow for large datasets as the offset increases, due to database performance issues.

### 3. **CursorPagination**
Cursor-based pagination provides a more performant method of pagination, especially for large datasets. Instead of page numbers or offsets, it uses an encoded cursor based on a field (usually a timestamp or unique identifier) to determine the "position" in the dataset.

- **URL Example**: `/api/items/?cursor=cD0yMDIxLTAxLTAx`
- **Configuration**: The client doesn't control the page number or offset, but instead provides a cursor for navigating forwards or backwards.
- **Settings**:
    ```python
    from rest_framework.pagination import CursorPagination

    class CustomCursorPagination(CursorPagination):
        page_size = 10  # Number of items per page
        ordering = '-created'  # The field used for ordering (usually timestamp or ID)
        cursor_query_param = 'cursor'  # Query parameter for the cursor
    ```

- **Pros**:
  - Efficient for large datasets since it avoids the performance issues associated with large offsets.
  - More robust and stable pagination for datasets that are frequently updated.

- **Cons**:
  - Less intuitive for users as the pagination is based on encoded cursors rather than page numbers or limits.
  - Cursor can’t be easily shared or bookmarked, unlike traditional page numbers.

### 4. **Custom Pagination**
In addition to the built-in pagination classes, you can create your own custom pagination class to implement specific pagination behavior that isn't covered by the above methods. You can extend from `BasePagination` and implement custom methods like `paginate_queryset` and `get_paginated_response`.

#### Example:
```python
from rest_framework.pagination import BasePagination
from rest_framework.response import Response

class CustomPagination(BasePagination):
    def paginate_queryset(self, queryset, request, view=None):
        # Custom logic to paginate
        return queryset[:10]  # Example: limiting to 10 items

    def get_paginated_response(self, data):
        return Response({
            'custom_key': 'custom_value',
            'results': data
        })
```

### Choosing the Right Pagination
- **PageNumberPagination**: Best for simple and small datasets where users expect traditional page navigation (e.g., blogs, e-commerce sites).
- **LimitOffsetPagination**: Suitable when you need more control over fetching data (e.g., APIs with large datasets where the client may need to load different chunks of data).
- **CursorPagination**: Ideal for APIs dealing with large datasets or frequently changing data (e.g., real-time updates, timelines).
- **Custom Pagination**: For more specific needs that the built-in classes don’t satisfy.

Each pagination type can be globally set in `settings.py` or applied on a per-view basis by specifying the pagination class in the view.
