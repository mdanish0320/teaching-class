Hereâ€™s a simplified requirement outline for a multi-tenant, Google Classroom-like application, suitable for students.

### Project Title: **Multi-Tenant Classroom Management Application**

### Project Overview
The goal is to create a basic multi-tenant web application where multiple schools (tenants) can independently manage their own classrooms, teachers, students, and assignments. Each tenant (school) should have isolated data while sharing the same application.

### Key Functional Requirements

1. **User Roles and Permissions**
   - **Admin (per tenant):** Manages teachers, students, and classes within their school.
   - **Teacher:** Manages their own classes, posts assignments, and views submissions.
   - **Student:** Views their classes, submits assignments, and accesses grades.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Implement **sign-up** and **login** functionality for all users (Admin, Teacher, Student).
   - Implement **role-based access control** to restrict access based on user roles.
   - Tenant-specific login URL structure (e.g., `schoolname.app.com` or `app.com/schoolname`).

3. **Multi-Tenancy Structure**
   - Each school (tenant) should operate in an isolated space, with separate data but shared resources.
   - Ensure data isolation for each tenant so users in one school cannot access data from another school.

4. **Classroom Management (Admin and Teacher)**
   - **Admin** can create and assign **teachers** and **students** to **classrooms**.
   - **Teacher** can create posts, upload files, and assign assignments in their assigned classrooms.
   - **Student** can view their enrolled classes, assignments, and grades.

5. **Assignment Management (Teacher and Student)**
   - **Teacher**: Can create, edit, and delete assignments within their classroom.
   - **Student**: Can view and submit assignments for their classes.
   - **Submission Status**: Track and display assignment status (e.g., Submitted, Pending, Graded).

6. **Assignment Grading (Teacher)**
   - Teachers can grade each student's submission and provide feedback.
   - Students can view their grades and feedback for each assignment.

### Task Breakdown:
1. **Create the Database**: Use MySQL Workbench to create a new database for the blogging application.

2. **Define the Tables**:
   - Define tables for each of the features described above (e.g., users, posts, categories, comments, likes, etc.).
   - Ensure that the relationships between the tables are established correctly (e.g., one-to-many and many-to-many).

3. **Establish Relationships**:
   - Set **primary keys** and **foreign keys** as needed to ensure data integrity.
   - Ensure that each post is associated with a user (author), each comment is linked to a post and a user, and categories can be linked to multiple posts.

4. **Generate the ERD**:
   - Once you have completed the database design, use MySQL Workbench to generate an **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)** to visually represent the database structure.

5. **Export the Database**:
   - Export the database design as a `.sql` file (the export should include the schema for all tables and relationships).

### Submission:
- Submit the **ERD** for review.
- Provide the **exported database schema** as a `.sql` file.

Good luck!
