In Django Rest Framework (DRF), when using a `ModelViewSet`, the lifecycle of a request involves several steps, during which various methods can be overridden. Here's the general order of method invocation during a typical request, along with a breakdown of what happens at each stage:

### Lifecycle Flow of a Request in `ModelViewSet`

1. **Initial Request**: A request is made to one of the endpoints of the `ModelViewSet` (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

2. **Authentication & Permissions**:
   - **`get_permissions()`**: This method is called first to determine the permissions for the incoming request. If the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions, the request proceeds; otherwise, an error response is returned.

3. **Request Method Handling**: Based on the HTTP method, one of the following methods will be invoked:

   - **For `GET` (List or Retrieve)**:
     - **`list()`**:
       - **`get_queryset()`**: Called to retrieve the base queryset.
       - **`filter_queryset()`**: Called to filter the queryset based on any query parameters.
       - **`get_serializer()`**: Called to get the appropriate serializer class.
       - **`Response`**: Returns the serialized data.

     - **`retrieve()`**:
       - **`get_object()`**: Called to retrieve the specific object based on the URL parameter.
       - **`get_serializer()`**: Called to get the serializer for the object.
       - **`Response`**: Returns the serialized data of the object.

   - **For `POST` (Create)**:
     - **`create()`**:
       - **`perform_create()`**: Called to handle the creation logic after data validation.
       - **`get_serializer()`**: Called to validate the incoming data and create the new object.
       - **`Response`**: Returns the serialized data of the newly created object.

   - **For `PUT` (Update)**:
     - **`update()`**:
       - **`get_object()`**: Called to retrieve the specific object to update.
       - **`perform_update()`**: Called to handle the update logic after data validation.
       - **`Response`**: Returns the serialized data of the updated object.

   - **For `PATCH` (Partial Update)**:
     - **`partial_update()`**:
       - **`get_object()`**: Called to retrieve the specific object to partially update.
       - **`perform_update()`**: Similar to the `update()` method, but for partial updates.
       - **`Response`**: Returns the serialized data of the updated object.

   - **For `DELETE` (Destroy)**:
     - **`destroy()`**:
       - **`get_object()`**: Called to retrieve the specific object to delete.
       - **`perform_destroy()`**: Called to handle the deletion logic.
       - **`Response`**: Returns a success response (usually HTTP 204 No Content).

### Detailed Method Invocation Order

Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the flow for each HTTP method:

#### 1. `GET` (List)
- `get_permissions()`
- `list()`
  - `get_queryset()`
  - `filter_queryset()`
  - `get_serializer()`
  - `Response`

#### 2. `GET` (Retrieve)
- `get_permissions()`
- `retrieve()`
  - `get_object()`
  - `get_serializer()`
  - `Response`

#### 3. `POST` (Create)
- `get_permissions()`
- `create()`
  - `get_serializer()`
  - `perform_create()`
  - `Response`

#### 4. `PUT` (Update)
- `get_permissions()`
- `update()`
  - `get_object()`
  - `get_serializer()`
  - `perform_update()`
  - `Response`

#### 5. `PATCH` (Partial Update)
- `get_permissions()`
- `partial_update()`
  - `get_object()`
  - `get_serializer()`
  - `perform_update()`
  - `Response`

#### 6. `DELETE` (Destroy)
- `get_permissions()`
- `destroy()`
  - `get_object()`
  - `perform_destroy()`
  - `Response`

### Important Notes
- **Super Calls**: In your overridden methods, you often want to call the `super()` method to ensure that you preserve the default behavior provided by the DRF. For instance, calling `super().get_queryset()` within your overridden `get_queryset()` method.
  
- **Flexibility**: You can override any of these methods to add custom logic specific to your application’s requirements. However, be careful to maintain the order and dependencies between methods, as shown above.

- **Error Handling**: If any of these methods raise exceptions (e.g., permission errors, not found errors), the flow will short-circuit, and a response will be returned immediately without continuing to the later steps.

### Conclusion

Understanding this lifecycle is essential for effectively customizing the behavior of your `ModelViewSet`. By following this method invocation order, you can ensure that your application adheres to DRF’s design patterns while implementing your custom business logic.
