# loop
# Write a program to display index and the values (both) of a list using for loop. consider a list l = [100, 200, 300, 400]
# output: 
# 0 100
# 1 200
# 2 300
# 3 400

# Write a program that find common values between 2 lists and also tells how many times the common value occurs.
# consider the list l1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] and l2 = ['e', 'b', 'g', 'd', 'f', 'h']
# output:
# {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 1, "d": 2, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 1}
# hint: use nested loop

# consider the number 2783, the number consists of 4 digits.
# Count the total number of digits in a number using while loop.
# instruction (hint):
# x = 2783
# counter = 0
# run while loop as long as x becomes 0
# increment the counter inside while loop
# divide x by 10 using floor division syntax "//"


# Write a program that takes user input and display it. The program keep ask user the input until user enters “0”


# Write a program and ask user to enter number, 5 times using while loop. store each value in list.
# calculate the sum of all values in a list

# Write a program to ask for a name until the user enters END. Print the name each time. When you are done, print "I am done."

# consider the list l1 [11, 33, 50]. use for loop to output the result like "113350"

# consider the following list ['cat', 'dog', 'hand', 'freedom', 'jump', 'frog', 'happy', 'popcorn', 'tiger']
# display the word that contains character longer than 5
# the output should be freedeom and popcorn

# functions

# Write a program to create a function that takes two arguments, name and age. print them inside function.

# Write a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.
# It should accept the employee’s name and salary and display both.
# If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary


# Write function that accepts different values as parameters and returns a list
# consider the below varables
# a = 4
# b = 8
# c = 10
# d = 12
# pass above values to the function and return the list
# output: [4, 8, 10, 12]


# Write a function called km_to_miles that takes kilometers as a parameter, converts it into miles and returns the result.

# Write a function called is_divisable_by_11 that takes an integer as an parameter and returns whether it is divisible by 11 or not.

# Write a function called get_highest that takes 2 numbers as parameters and returns the highest of the 2 numbers.

# Write a function called fuel_cost that takes 2 numbers as parameter "distance" as required arg 
# and "fuel_per_liter" as optional arg that has default value to 280. 
# The function should return the cost in Rs.


# Write a function called is_valid_email  that takes an email address as an argument and returns True/False depending on whether it is a valid email address.
# Check rules:
# Must contain at least 1 character before the at symbol
# Must contain an @ symbol
# Must have at-least 1 character after the @ symbol and before the period(.)
# Must contain at least 1 character after the last period(.).
# Maximum 256 characters
# Must start with a letter or a number

# hint: use if statement 6 times to check each rule. if any one rule failed return false

Take a variable store i.e
Store = {“name”: “my store”, “inventory”: [], “orders”: []}

Add 5 items in the inventory using a function “add_item”
id, name, price and quantity

Take user input unless it says “done”
Display user updated inventory items every time
Ask user to type id of the item to purchase or type “done” to checkout
Each time only 1 quantity will by subtracted from the item

Functions: add_item_in_inventory, add_item_in_basket(), checkout()
On checkout, print “{quantity} {item} sold in {store}”
