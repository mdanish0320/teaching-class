## API Documentation

### Swagger UI

Access the API documentation using Swagger UI at:
- [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8000/swagger/)

## Authentication

This application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To get started, you need to log in and obtain an access token.

### Login to Get JWT Token

**Endpoint**: `/auth/login`

**Request**:
```json
{
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
    "refresh_token": "string",
    "access_token": "string"
}
```

Use the `access_token` as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for accessing protected endpoints.

## Permissions on Post APIs

The application defines specific permissions for each action on posts. Below is the permission structure:

```python
def get_permissions(self):
    if self.action == "list":
        # Public access to the list action
        return [AllowAny()]

    if self.action in ["update", "partial_update"]:
        # Author or Moderator can update or partially update
        return [IsAuthenticated(), IsAuthorOrModerator()]
    
    if self.action in ["destroy"]:
        # Only the author of the post can update, partially update, or delete
        return [IsAuthenticated(), IsAuthor()]

    # Default permission for other actions like 'retrieve'
    return [IsAuthenticated()]
```

### Explanation of Permissions

- **List**: Public access is allowed.
- **Update, Partial Update**: Only the author and moderator of the post can perform these actions.
- **Destroy**: Only the author of the post can perform these actions.
- **Retrieve**: Only authenticated users can retrieve post details.
  
Additional permissions are defined for moderators to assist with content moderation.
