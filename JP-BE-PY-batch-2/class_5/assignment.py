# Write a Python program to check if a list is empty or not.

# 1. output the numbers from 1 to 10 using range function and for loop
# output should be like
# 1
# 2

# 2. output the numbers from 35 to 50 using range function and for loop
# output should be like
# 35
# 36
# 37
# etc


# 3. output the numbers from -15 to -25 using range function and for loop
# output should be like
# -15
# -16
# -17
# etc

# 4. output the numbers from 5 to -10 using range function and for loop
# output should be like

# etc


# 7. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list use for loop. consider the list [3, 5, 2, 1, 4]
# output should be 15
# hint: 
# create a variable x outside the loop and assign the value 0
# inside the loop increment the value of x with the local variable of loop
# x += i
