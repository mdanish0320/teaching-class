Here are a few of the major differences between InnoDB and MyISAM:

InnoDB has row-level locking. MyISAM only has full table-level locking.
InnoDB has what is called referential integrity which involves supporting foreign keys (RDBMS) and relationship constraints, MyISAM does not (DMBS).
InnoDB supports transactions, which means you can commit and roll back. MyISAM does not.
InnoDB is more reliable as it uses transactional logs for auto recovery. MyISAM does not.
