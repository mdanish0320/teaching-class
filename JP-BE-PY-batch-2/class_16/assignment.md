# E-Commerce Database and Python Application Assignment

## Task 1: Design the Database
Design a database for an e-commerce application with the following tables:
- `Users`
- `Categories`
- `Products`
- `Orders`
- `Order_Details`
- `Payments`

## Task 2: Develop the Python Application
Create a Python application that interacts with the database to add data and display key business metrics.

### Data Entry Requirements:
Populate the database with data using your Python application. Ensure the data is realistic and that the metrics generated reflect meaningful numbers, avoiding trivial values like "0" or "1".

## Metrics to Display:
Your application should be able to generate and display the following metrics:

### 1. Sales Metrics:
- **Total Revenue:** Calculate the total earnings over a specific period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Revenue by Product:** Display revenue generated by each product or category.
- **Top Selling Products:** Identify the most sold products within a specified timeframe.
- **Revenue by Region/City:** Break down the revenue by different geographical locations.

**Example:**
- **Total Revenue (This Month):** $75,000
- **Revenue by Product (Overall):**
  - Product A: $20,000
  - Product B: $15,000
  - Product C: $25,000
  - Product D: $15,000
- **Top Selling Products (This Month):**
  - Product C: 750 units
  - Product A: 600 units
  - Product B: 450 units
  - Product D: 300 units
- **Revenue by Region/City (Overall):**
  - New York: $25,000
  - Los Angeles: $18,000
  - Chicago: $12,000
  - Houston: $8,000
  - Other Cities: $12,000

### 2. Order Metrics:
- **Total Orders:** The total number of orders placed.
- **Pending Orders:** Orders that have not yet been processed or shipped.
- **Cancelled Orders:** The number of orders that have been cancelled.

**Example:**
- **Total Orders (This Month):** 600
- **Pending Orders (Overall):** 60
- **Cancelled Orders (Overall):** 25
- **Successful Orders (Overall):** 20

### 3. Payment Metrics:
- **Pending Payments:** The total amount of payments that are still pending.
- **Successful Payments:** The total amount of payments successfully received.

**Example:**
- **Pending Payments (This Month):** $5,000
- **Successful Payments (This Month):** $68,750

### 4. Product Metrics:
- **Inventory Levels:** Current stock levels for each product.
- **Out of Stock Products:** List of products that are currently out of stock.

**Example:**
- **Inventory Levels (Overall):**
  - Product A: 150 units
  - Product B: 80 units
  - Product C: 200 units
  - Product D: 120 units
- **Out of Stock Products:** 10

### 5. Geographical Metrics:
- **Top Cities by Sales:** Cities with the highest number of purchases.
- **Top Countries by Sales:** Countries where the most revenue is generated.

**Example:**
- **Top Cities by Sales (This Month):**
  - New York: 200 orders
  - Los Angeles: 150 orders
  - Chicago: 100 orders
  - Houston: 80 orders
  - Phoenix: 70 orders
- **Top Countries by Sales (This Month):**
  - USA: $75,000
  - Canada: $5,000
  - UK: $3,500
  - Australia: $2,500
  - Germany: $1,500

## Application Features:
Your Python application should include a startup menu with the following options:

1. **Add Data:**
   - Add Category
   - Add Product
   - Add Customer
   - Add Order
   - Add Payment

2. **Display Stats:**
   - Sales Metrics
   - Order Metrics
   - Payment Metrics
   - Product Metrics
   - Geographical Metrics
