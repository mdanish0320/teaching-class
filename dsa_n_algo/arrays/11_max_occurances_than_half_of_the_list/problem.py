"""
Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, write a program to return an element that occurs more than N/2 times in the given array. 
You may consider that such an element always exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input Format
: N = 3, nums[] = {3,2,3}
Result
: 3
Explanation
: When we just count the occurrences of each number and compare with half of the size of the array, you will get 3 for the above solution.
