# Write a program that accepts 1 input from user and check if the number is divisible by 2 and 3 both.

# for example
# input1 is 10
# output should be "10 is only divisible by 2"

# input1 is 9
# output should be "9 is only divisible by 3"

# input1 is 12
# output should be "12 is divisible by 2 and 3"
